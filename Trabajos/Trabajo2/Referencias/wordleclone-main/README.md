# Wordl-ish
This game is a clone of Wordle, which is based off Mastermind, which is based off Bulls and Cows.

In this game, players try to guess a 5 letter word in 6 guesses or less. Each word guess, the square will tell you whether the letter was correct - Green if the letter is in the correct position; Yellow if the letter is in the word but not in the correct position; Grey if the letter is not in the word.

To run this game, you need to install the pygame Python module with ```pip install pygame```.

Some ideas planned, but not sure if I want to work on them at the moment:
 - Visual keyboard
 - Companion word solver
 - Stat tracking
